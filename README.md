Portland Census vs. Zenger Racial Demographics
Takeway points: 
	-Hitting BIPOC communities as evident from comparison to Portland Census
	-Still very low participation for American Indian population

Zenger 2019 vs Zenger 2022
Takeaway points:
	-More racially diverse compared to 2019
	-Would like more data... only one other year to compare it with

<h3>Financials</h3>
-Zenger offers sliding scale payment system for Summer Camp: 6 different payment options from $0 - $550
Made chart totalling how many participants in each bucket

-The $50.00 "spot" stood out to me. There are 93, or 24% of total participants, who paid $50. This could either mean that we are hitting lower-income families, or that some of these participants are "bad actors".
