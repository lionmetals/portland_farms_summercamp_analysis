<h2>Prepare</h2>
<OL>
<LI>Data provided by Portland Farms (2022 and 2019)
<UL>
<LI>Racial Demographics 
<LI>Household Income
<LI>Total number of participants and how much they paid
</UL>

<h2>Process</h2>
	<h3>Tools</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Google Sheets: Useful for analyzing smaller amounts of data. Easily replicable for managers since they use Google Sheets.
	<li>Google Slideshow: Easily viewable for all members since the organization uses Google Slides for presentations.
	</ul>
	
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Breakdown of Racial Demographics of Summer Camp Participants</h3>
Pure breakdown of demographics, but hard to read since so many categories. 
<br>
<ul>

</ul>
<br>
Instead, created restructured data and created new graph using Portland Census method. Graph Below shows data from <b> Portland Metro vs. Portland Farms</b>
<br>

<br>
<b>Takeway points:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Catering to more BIPOC communities compared to Portland Metro</li>
	<li>Still very low participation for American Indian population</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Portland Farms 2019 vs  Portland Farms 2022</h3>
<img width="785" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2 18 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114360846/210660608-f9d3bea8-2cf6-42e9-aec6-c9dc7c23c01b.png">
<br>
<b>Takeaway points:</b>
<ul>
	<li>More racially diverse compared to 2019</li>
	<li>Would like more data... only one other year to compare it with</li>
</ul>

<h3>Median Household Income</h3>
The participants median household income is 22% lower than Portland's median household income. This is evidence that we are reaching our target audience of lower-income families

<h3>Financials</h3>
Portland Farms offers sliding scale payment system for Summer Camp: 6 different payment options from $0 - $550. Made chart totaling how many participants at each price point.

<br>
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>The $50.00 "spot" stood out to me. There are 93, or 24% of total participants, who paid $50. This could either mean that we are serving under-resourced communities or that some of these participants are "bad actors"
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Next, I wanted to look at aggregate totals for each price point
<br>

<br>
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>“$550 Spot” makes up ~42% of total gross income</li>
</ul>

<h3>Portland Farms Compared</h3>
Was asked by manager to compare Portland Farms' costs with competitors
<br>
<img width="750" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2 30 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114360846/210662378-a9c78b1d-c790-47db-9bc1-427068414184.png">
<br>
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>Our average price per kid is lower than industry average</li>
<li>However, we currently have the highest “high.” Might be tough to increase this… </li>
<li>Limitations: Don’t have full financial breakdown of other organizations. This could affect data analysis </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ideas for Pricing Structure Changes</h3>
<ol>
<b>
<li>10% Increase Across the Board</li>
<li>Limit $50 Spot to 50 participants</li>
<li>Increase High End ($325 and $550 Spots)</li>
</b>
</ol>
<h4>Option 1: 10% Increase Across the Board</h4>
<img width="920" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2 35 04 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114360846/210662925-856e75f3-75cc-481d-acc6-ea7d8bf9a517.png">
<br>
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>New total: $92,730.00 <- $8,430 increase from 2022</li>
<li>Average Per Kid: $238 <- still lower than industry average</li>
<li>Might be tough to increase $550 to $605 <- Highest competitor is at $525</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option 2: Limit $50 Spot to 50 participants</h4>
For this hypothetical, I took the 43 extra $50 participants and spread them out into the $100 and $200 Spots. I increased the number of $100 Spot participants by 30 and $150 Spot participants by 13

<img width="871" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2 41 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114360846/210663808-1eaacbe7-5daa-4ee3-ad41-cdf5853e4941.png">
<br>
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>New total: $87,750.00 <- $3,450 increase from 2022</li>
<li>Average Per Kid: $226.16 <- still lower than industry average</li>
<li>Could potentially be making camp unaffordable for some families</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option 3: Increase High End</h4>
For this, I increased the $325 spot to $350 and the $550 spot to $600
<br>
<img width="891" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2 42 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114360846/210663878-1aea6ecd-5846-44dd-84b5-630ec982642a.png">
<b>Takeaway Points</b>
<ul>
<li>New total: $87,750.00 <- $5,150 increase from 2022</li>
<li>Average Per Kid: $230.54 <- still lower than industry average</li>
<li>Again, Might be a tough sell. Highest competitor caps out at $525</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are serving BIPOC and under-resourced communities</li>
<li>Racial diversity was better in 2022 than in 2019</li>
<li>Portland Farms’s Pricing Structure is competitive compared to other Summer Camps in Portland</li>
